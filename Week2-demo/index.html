<h2>Special Moments in 80s.</h2>
<p>Growing up in the 80's was a really great time. At the weekend I where allowed to play out all day but I had to be back home for tea.
    I where very lucky because where I lived there where so many amazing places I could go and play, 
    there where many fields, woods, ponds, canal, and other amazing places to play.</p>
<p>Sunday, where a sunday roast tea with all the trimmings, my mum's yorkshire puddings where amazing, it where one my favourite parts
    of my sunday roast tea. Then as a family we would watch tv together, it where Heartbeat, Casualty and then London's Burning.
    These are just some of my most favourite times when growing up.</p>
<p>Back in the 80's if we wanted to watch the newest movies or just watch any film you had to be a member of a video shop,
    so you could rent movies and films, because the cost of buying Movies on VHS where so expensive.</p>
<p contenteditable ="true" spellcheck ="true">Music where first released on Vinyl format, Then came the cassette tape. On a sunday on the radio they did the top 20 charts, and
    this where a time when you tried to record the top 20 on a cassette type and try to pause out the talking in between the songs, 
    it where so annoying because the radio dj would talk right at the beginning over the first part of the song and then just right before the end.
